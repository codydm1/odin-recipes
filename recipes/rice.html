            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Water</li>

        <ol>
            <li>
                WASH THE RICE: Rinse under running water, rubbing the grains together between the palms of your hands; continue this rinsing until the water runs fairly clear. THIS WILL TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES; DON'T RUSH THIS MOST IMPORTANT STEP!
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Place rice in a covered sauce pan; add water to 1/2-inch above the rice; put on high heat. Stay in the area -- don't fall asleep -- PAY ATTENTION!
            </li><br>
            <li>
                As soon as it boils rapidly, reduce heat to medium/low and keep simmering for 10 minutes. DO NOT PEEK. DO NOT OPEN THE LID.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Remove pot from burner but STILL DO NOT OPEN THE LID; let the rice rest undisturbed for five minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Fluff the rice with a pair of chopsticks before serving.
            </li><br>
        </ol>
